# Jasbin's SQL Portfolio

## Welcome to my SQL portfolio! 

This repository showcases various SQL queries and projects that Iâ€™ve worked on. The examples cover a range of SQL topics including basic querying, data aggregation, filtering, and more. Iâ€™m continually adding new projects as I learn more about SQL and database management.

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback:

### My SQL Journey:
Iâ€™m currently learning SQL to enhance my data analysis skills and build a solid foundation in database management. My goal is to use SQL to extract meaningful insights from data and build efficient, scalable databases.
